## introduction


## removing metadata
+ Image metadata can be removed manually with Windows, using ImageOptim on Mac, using GIMP that supported by several OS, dan using mobile apps ([Arsenault, 2018](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/image-metadata)).


## code
+ There are some JavaScript libraries that can access the Exif data in digital photos, e.g Piexifjs, not only read but also edit and erase it ([deVilla, 2021](https://auth0.com/blog/read-edit-exif-metadata-in-photos-with-javascript/)).
+ Read and remove metdata data form photos can be performed also with Python, e.g. exif package ([deVilla, 2021](https://auth0.com/blog/read-edit-exif-metadata-in-photos-with-python/)).
+ With Java not only Exif metadata can be read, but also IPTC/IIM and XMP metadata ([Hillert, 2022](https://medium.com/@hillert/read-write-image-metadata-with-java-part-1-d5e2057c80d9)).
