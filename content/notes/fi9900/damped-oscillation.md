+ `15-fri` `BE` Application of granular system on bridge approach slab to smooth the joints.
+ `15-fri` `AP` Solid and hollow coffee beans or berries dry separation.
+ `12-tue` `AU` Equation of motion of a damped oscillation ([Richmond, 2015](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys207/lectures/damped/damped_theory.html))
$$\tag{1}
\ddot{x} + 2 \gamma \dot{x} + \omega^2 x = 0.
$$
What would be the solution if $\gamma = \gamma(x)$ and $\omega = \omega(x)$?
