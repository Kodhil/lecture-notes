## introduction
+ Genetic algorithm or GA is an algorithm for optimization, which can overcome local optimum in finding global otimum ([Binus, 2018](https://socs.binus.ac.id/2018/12/08/genetic-algorithm/)).
+ This heuristic search is inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution, which reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation ([Mallawaarachchi, 2017](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3)).
+ It is intelligent exploitation of random search provided with historical data to direct the search into the region of better performance in solution space, where it commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization problems and seach problems ([overide, 2023](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/genetic-algorithms/)).
