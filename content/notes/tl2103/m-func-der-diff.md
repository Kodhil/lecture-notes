## differentiation and derivative
+ Differentiation is a technique which can be used for analyzing the way in which a functions change, or in particular, it measures how rapidly a function is changing at any point ([HELM, 2008](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/images/Intro_diffrntiatn.pdf)).
+ In mathematics, differentiation is a process of finding the derivative, or rate of change, of a function, which can be carried out by purely algegraic manipulations using three basic derivatives, four rules of operation, and a knowledge of how to manipulate functions ([Britannica, 2022](https://www.britannica.com/science/differentiation-mathematics)).
