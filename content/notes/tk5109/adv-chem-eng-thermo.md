## data
+ There are at least four classes in different program with course code TK5109, where each is taught by different lecturer or team teaching.
+ Exam variations are as follow.

  Class | Duration | Information
  :- | :- | :-
  A | |
  B | |
  C | |

  The A, B, C are related to 01, 02, 03 but not yet in order.

## notes
+ It is related to the course of Advanced Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics, which is given in cooperation with the National Electrical Company.
+ In TK5109 following topics are taught, which are 
  > equation of state, compressibility, intermolecular forcesmixing rule, fugacity, ideal solution, non-ideal solution, phase equilibrium criteria, phase equilibrium calculation, vapour-liquid equilibrium ratio.
+ It has more details as
  > equation of sate (ideal gas, virial, and cubic), acentric factor and compressibility, intermolecular forces, dipole moment and potential energy, mixing rule, fugacity, ideal solution, Lewis-Randall and Henry rules, non-ideal solution, activity coefficient, mixing effects and the relation between excess and thermodynamics properties, phase equilibrium criteria, phase equilibrium calculation by using cubic equation, activity coefficient calculation by using expanded excess function (Wuhl, Redlich-Kister, van Laar, Margules, Wilson, ASOG, NRTL, UNIQUAC and UNIFAC), vapour-liquid equilibrium ratio according to Chao-Seader, BWRS and GPA graphs and convergence pressure parameters.
 + Participants of this ccurse will able to calculate thermodynamic quantities using real gas concepts including liquid-vapor equilibrium and reaction equilibrium for a real system that is useful for designing and solving problems in distillation columns, flash drums, and reactors (according to outcomes a,b,c).
